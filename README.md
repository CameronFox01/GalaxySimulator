# 🌌 Galaxy Simulator (Haskell)

A physics-based galaxy simulation that models the gravitational interactions between stars and planets.  
Users can customize parameters such as:
- Number of celestial bodies  
- Initial positions  
- Initial velocities  

The simulation calculates gravitational forces at each timestep and updates the system to visualize the dynamic motion of a galaxy.

## ✨ Features
- N-body gravitational simulation  
- Configurable number of bodies  
- Customizable initial conditions  
- Real-time position updates  
- Pure functional implementation in Haskell  

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Modeling complex, physics-driven systems  
- Understanding N-body gravitational calculations  
- Using Haskell for simulations and functional data modeling  
- Structuring simulations in a purely functional paradigm
